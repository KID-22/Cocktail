# Dataset

Due to the file size limitations on the GitHub repository, we have only uploaded the smallest three datasets to facilitate quick reproducibility checks. These include NFCorpus, SciFact, and our newly collected and annotated dataset, NQ-UTD.

For all 16 datasets in Cocktail, please check out our Hugging Face (HF) page: https://huggingface.co/IR-Cocktail.
